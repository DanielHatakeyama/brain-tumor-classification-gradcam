## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)** to interpret a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for brain tumor classification. The goal is to visualize which regions of the input image the model focuses on when making predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process.

## Key Features
- **Dataset**: Brain tumor MRI images from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
- **Model**: CNN trained for tumor classification.
- **Grad-CAM**: Visualizes model attention and highlights regions contributing to predictions.
- **Results**: Includes heatmaps showing model interpretability.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   CODE
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-classification-gradcam.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification-gradcam
   CODE

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   Install the required dependencies:
   CODE
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   CODE

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Launch Jupyter and open the notebook:
   CODE
   jupyter notebook brain-tumor-classification-gradcam.ipynb
   CODE

## Requirements
The project uses the following libraries:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV

See the full list in the `requirements.txt` file.

## Results
